|0. Administration applies these rules on its discretion.|
| :------------ |
|That means that Administration is free not to punish for violations if it's necessary, or if there's no grievances to the offender.|

|1.  Don't be an asshole.|
| :------------ |
|This is just a game, and we here for enjoyment. Long-term conflicts, intentional harm to the community, and toxic behavior are not allowed, and will be punished. This rule does not apply to minor conflicts.|

|2.  Please, do your job.|
| :------------ |
|Engine must be started at the correct time, people shouldn't die in medbay's reception while doctors are having tea, and so on. Remember, that the safety and status of the whole ship are dependant on the work of crucial roles. Heads and AI must not leave after round's start. But if you have a serious reason which prevents you from doing your job, it's ok to leave.|

|3.  Multi accounting.|
| :------------ |
|This disrupts Administration's work, and is punished harshly. If you want to change your account, you should discuss it with the Administration. Admins can use multi accounts for their purposes.|

|4.  Intentional murder/isolation/infliction of grievous bodily harm without any reason.|
| :------------ |
|You should have a strong cause for killing. It can be: self-defence, long-time roleplayed conflict, the fulfillment of a order (The one who gave an order to you will be responsible) and the enforcement of a sentence.|
|The violation always will be considerated in context of earlier events. Usually, the one who generates the situation is the one who takes responsibility.|
|Full isolation of a player is equivilant to killing them.|
|Infliction of grievous bodily harm, which causes long healing in medbay (more than 30 minutes) is punished half as severley as murder.|

|5. Do not use IC knowledge, which is unknown to your character.|
| :------------ |
|Do not use knowledge gained from OOC sources in-game.|
|Do not use other roles' difficult devices. Basic operations, like wall dismantling, are known by all jobs, but surgery and the engine should be limited to specialists. With the exception of related jobs, like robotics, or Jacks-of-all-trades: scientists and the RD.|
|The crew is aware of existance of all special roles and have approximate information about their methods, but doesn't know anything about their skills and devices.|

|6. Breaking the immersion.|
| :------------ |
|Your manner of speaking must fit to how you are roleplaying, but not to how you normally behave in internet chatrooms and the like. Ideally, your speech should try to fit within normal grammar rules and literary standards as much as possible. Without any emojis, internet-slang or text-cuts: your characters communicate via voice.|
|Do not act in a way that disrupts the setting and lore.
|When you use flavor text, do not use it to write infromation about your character, their story or anything of that sort. Only your appearance (and some OOC notes if it's needed).
|Do not take names of famous figures (Adolf Hitler) or popular characters (Darth Wader). You can roleplay less famous heroes, but you should discuss it with the administration first.|

|7. Communicate correctly.|
| :------------ |
|It's hard to roleplay as adults crewing a spaceship, when people talk like schoolboys. Please maintain correct spelling and grammas as much as possible: your text should be comfortable to read.|
|There are two language-separated servers: Russian and English. General interaction must fit to the server's language.

|8. IC in OOC.|
| :------------ |
Do not discuss the events of the current round in any OOC channels, this includes the forums, OOC, discord, and the like.|

|9. Out-of-game cooperation.
| :------------ |
|Any out-of-game  communication is not allowed. This is metagaming and will be punished hard.

|10. ERP.|
| :------------ |
|Erotic roleplay is restricted due to autistic influence to the game progress. Hugs'n'kisses are allowed, but nothing more than that. You heard the man.
